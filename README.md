## Introduction

The roads are becoming more populated yearly with Electric Vehicles as the demand increases. In this project, we seek to understand the landscape of the EV market by looking at both Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV). The dataset that was used for this project was sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ishmaelkiptoo/us-electric-vehicle-population-data).

## Data Review

This dataset contains information regarding the location of the car and technical information about the vehicle such as the Model, Type, Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility, and other valuable information. 

## PowerBI Dashboard

The dashboard KPIs seek to fulfill 4 requirements:
1. Total Vehicle (Understand the spread of Electric Vehicles on today's roadways)
2. Average Electric Range (Determine the average range of today's electric vehicles)
3. Total BEV Vehicles and % (Find the amount of vehicles that are BEV)
4. Total PHEV Vehicles and % (Find the amount of vehicles that are PHEV)

The visualizations seek to fulfill 5 requirements:
1. Total Vehicles by Model Year
2. Total Vehicles by State
3. Top 10 Vehicles by Make
4. Total Vehicles CAFV eligible
5. Top 10 Vehicles by Model

## Conclusion

### Next Steps
* See if some cities have more vehicles that are CAFV-eligible
